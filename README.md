🚀 Employee Management System (MERN Stack)
A Role-Based Employee Management System built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) designed for small and mid-sized organizations to manage employee details, departments, leaves, and salaries efficiently.

🧠 Problem Statement
Managing employees, leave requests, departments, and salary distribution manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Many small to mid-sized companies still use spreadsheets and emails for these operations, which leads to inefficiencies and lack of centralized control.

Role-based dashboards (Admin vs Employee).

Department and employee management.

Leave application and approval flow.

Salary management and deposit tracking.
